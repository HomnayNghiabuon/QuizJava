001#KHO#It was previously believed that dinosaurs were cold-blooded creatures, like reptiles. However, a recent discovery has led researchers to believe they may have been warm-blooded. The fossilized remains of a 66 million-year-old dinosaur’s heart were discovered and examined by x-ray. The basis for the analysis that they were warm-blooded is the number of chambers in the heart as well as the existence of a single aorta.
Most reptiles have three chambers in their hearts, although some do have four. But those that have four chambers, such as the crocodile, have two arteries to mix the oxygen-heavy blood with oxygen-lean blood. Reptiles are cold-blooded, meaning that they are dependent on the environment for body heat. Yet the fossilized heart had four chambers in the heart as well as a single aorta. The single aorta means that the oxygen-rich blood was completely separated from the oxygen-poor blood and sent through the aorta to all parts of the body.
Mammals, on the other hand, are warm-blooded, meaning that they generate their own body heat and are thus more tolerant of temperature extremes. Birds and mammals, because they are warm blooded, move more swiftly and have greater physical endurance than reptiles.
Scientists believe that the evidence now points to the idea that all dinosaurs were actually warm-blooded.Ironically, the particular dinosaur in which the discovery was made was a Tescelosaurus, which translates to “marvelous lizard”. A lizard, of course, is a reptile.#

002#KHO#Mount Rushmore is a well-known monument in the Black Hills of South Dakota that features the countenances of four United States presidents: Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Lincoln. What is not so well known is 
that the process of creating this national treasure was not exactly an uneventful one. Mount Rushmore was the project of the visionary sculptor John Gutzen de la Mothe Borglum, who was born 
in Idaho but studied sculpture in Paris in his youth and befriended the famous French sculptor Auguste Rodin. In 1927 Borglum was granted a commission by the federal government to create the sculpture on Mount 
Rushmore. Though he was nearly sixty years old when he started, he was undaunted by the enormity of the 
project and the obstacles that it engendered. He optimistically asserted that the project would be completed within five years, not caring to recognize the potential problems that such a massive project would involve, 
the problems of dealing with financing, with government bureaucracy, and with Mother Nature herself. An example of what Mother Nature had to throw at the project was the fissure - or large crack - that developed 
in the granite where Jefferson was being carved. Jefferson had to be moved to the other side of Washington, next to Roosevelt because of the break in the stone. The work that had been started on the first Jefferson had to be dynamited away.
Mount Rushmore was not completed within the five years predicted by Borglum and was in fact not actually completed within Borglum's lifetime, although it was almost finished. Borglum died on March 6. 1941, at the 
age of seventy' four, after fourteen years of work on the presidents. His son, Lincoln Borglum, who had worked with his father throughout the project, completed the monument within eight months of his father's death.#
