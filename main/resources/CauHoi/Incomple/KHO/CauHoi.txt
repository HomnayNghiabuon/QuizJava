001#KHO#ChatGPT is a language model developed by Open AI that uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like responses to text-based prompts or questions. GPT stands for "Generative Pre-Trained Transformer", __(1)__ is a type of neutral network architecture that has been trained on large amount of text data.
The GPT model is (2)______ of generating coherent and contextually relevant responses to a wide range of prompts, making it useful for a variety of applications, such as chatbots, language translation, and content creation. As a language model, chat GPT is designed to learn and understand the structure of human_(3)___, enabling it to generate responses that sound like they were written by a human.
ChatGPT gets it information from a vast corpus of text data that has been preprocessed and used to train the model. This corpus includes a diverse range of sources, such as books, articles, web pages, and (4)______ forms of text-based content that are available on the internet. (5)_______, the responses it generates can incorporate knowledge and information that it has learned from this training data.
Everyone wonders if his tool will eliminate the majority of jobs and put a huge majority of people out of work. This is what GPT Chat's answered when ask the question.

002#KHO#The Solar System
The solar system consists of the Sun and the celestial bodies, including planets, moons, asteroids, and comets, that are bound by its gravity. (1), the Sun, a massive ball of hot, glowing gases, is the central and most significant component of the solar system. It provides the light and heat necessary for the existence of life on Earth.
Moving (2) from the Sun, the first four planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are rocky and relatively small. (3), the outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are gas giants with no solid surface. Each planet has unique characteristics and features that make it fascinating to astronomers.
Moons, or natural satellites, orbit many planets in the solar system. Earth, for example, has one moon, while Jupiter has dozens. (4), moons play a crucial role in the gravitational stability of their parent planets.
Beyond the planets, asteroids and comets are remnants from the early solar system. Asteroids are rocky bodies, while comets are icy bodies that develop a glowing tail when they approach the Sun. (5), these small celestial bodies offer valuable insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system.
